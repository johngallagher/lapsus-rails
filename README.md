Lapsus Prototype
================

Objective
---------

A time tracker that is minimal hassle and tells you how long you spend on projects.

Killer usability and really fast. Looks nice too. Most importantly - really useful!

Maximise intelligence to reduce data input.



Goal 1
======

Track time on local documents

Stories
--------

As a user I want to assign entries to projects
As a user I want to see how much time I've spent on each project
As a user I want to manage projects (CRUD)
As a user I'd like to POST my times to an endpoint






My biggest blocker is fear of being crap.
